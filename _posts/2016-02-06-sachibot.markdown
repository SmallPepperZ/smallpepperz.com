SachiBot is a discord bot that I made a while back to learn python. It doesn't have any documentation yet, but you can figure out how it works from `%help [command]` or reading the code at the linked github repository. 
It can notably not play tic tac toe, but it can give you a perfectly captioned dog picture with `%dog`, or an ~~inferior~~ cat picture with `%cat`. 

You can also check minecraft server statuses (I think) and get player skins and stuff with some command, probably.

My personal favorite feature is the incredibly informative command `%areyouthere` which will tell you if the bot is offline or not. It is of great importance to mention this will return no message if the bot is indeed, offline.
