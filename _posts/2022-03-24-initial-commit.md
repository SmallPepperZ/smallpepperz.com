# Initial Commit

Well, this is the 4th time I'm trying to redo this website. The old one was OK, but it felt too extravagant. Hopefully I'll stick with this one.

I might stick with this blogging thing, I might not. We'll see.

If you are the kind stranger known as "Michaeltom" who so elequently said "uriefeodeighrkfldjiijofofjmvkdnsisdiehiusfiajfhweiuioidjsjsbfiadjasifaijdfifijsaaiwghifadja," you'll have to [email me](mailto:me@smallpepperz.com) for all future inqueries, as I've don't have a contact form anymore
